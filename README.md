# Job Scraper

#### Video Demo: [Youtube](https://youtu.be/LDY-Mbp0nts)

#### Description: My project is scrapping current job offers as junior Python developer from the website [JustJoinIt](https://justjoin.it/)

I wanted to learn more about web scraping, because it is a good tool for automating some tasks and collecting data. I tried to make my project simple, so I didn't use OOP or complex libraries. Even though it took me about 9 hours to complete, including reserach, coding and writing documentation. Before this project I worked on some games using pygame, but I did them while following tutorial or using GPT. I wanted to make something on my own, without following instructions from youtube or AI and there it is ðŸ˜€

## How it works?

For now I have predifined links to the website, which I'm scrapping using requests module.
HTML response is then passed to the BeautifulSoup module, because it's easier to work with.

First request I send, recieves all current job postings, according to my filter which is specified in the url.
From the response I'm getting job title and url to the offer.

When I have those informations stored into dictionary, I send requests for each job offer.
Then I collect skills required for the position and the level of proficiency with that skill/library.
This data is then added to the dictionary.

Finally I save those dictionaries in a json file.

## Future improvments

I want to develop my project further as I learn new things.
I want to scrap more websites, there are 3 main sites for IT roles in my country.
I will nest things using OOP making the code cleaner and easier to scale.
I would like to present data on my personal website and create some charts with statistics. So I would be able to track current trends in a job market and potentially develop my skills according to demand.
